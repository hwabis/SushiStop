this game is very buggy

# SushiStop
Clone of the card game Sushi Go! Check out the original rules [here](https://www.fgbradleys.com/rules/rules2/SushiGo-rules.pdf).

To play, one player has to run the program in SushiStop.Server. Then I like to publicly expose the IP/port with ngrok. 
The game can start after at least 2 players have joined the server.

Card sprites are from MapleStory. Made with [osu!framework](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework) and [NetCoreServer](https://github.com/chronoxor/NetCoreServer).
